# Template Application

Meteor Core is a light-weight boilerplate application for getting started
build applications as quickly as possible **sans** all the boring bits.

The stack is **very** opinionated, and was really just created by me so that
I didn't have to spend time setting up route files and user logins (really,
who's doing that more than once?).

Feel free to use this code however you see fit, especially if you want to
jump straight into building a web application using Meteor + Blaze.

## Getting Started

After downloading directory and navigating to the directory in your terminal,
type "meteor" to launch the application in your browser on localhost:3000.
